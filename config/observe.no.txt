This is a total hack...caused by the fact that by instantiating the observers,
rails will look at the models, which will cause acts_as_solr to look for the
tables, which will not have been created yet in the case of the initial migration.

Once the initial migration has run, enable observers by copying this file to
$RAILS_ROOT/config/observe.txt
